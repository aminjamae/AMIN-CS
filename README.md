this content  about the Implementation of linked list .
there are four types of linked lists & Their implementation.
In computer science, linked lists are fundamental data structures used for dynamic data storage.
They consist of nodes connected by pointers, enabling flexible data manipulation.
Four primary types of linked lists are commonly implemented:
Singly Linked List: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node, forming a unidirectional chain.
Doubly Linked List: Nodes maintain two pointers, one to the next node and another to the previous, allowing bidirectional traversal.
Circular Linked List: The last node connects back to the first, creating a circular structure for continuous traversal.
Doubly Circular Linked List: Combines circular and doubly linked properties, enabling bidirectional and cyclic navigation.
